UML specification diagrams in a single map
===

This project shows the diagrams of [UML specification 2.5.1](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1/PDF/) in a single map. Click on the image below to open the map in *Diagram Map* (takes a few seconds to open). If you want to know about *Diagram Map*, see [this post](https://dev.to/takaakit/diagram-map-tracing-uml-sysml-elements-across-diagrams-49i7).

Required to open the model file (uml_specification_2.5.1.asta)
---
* [Astah](https://astah.net/download) Professional/UML/Viewer **ver.10.0** or higher.

Required to generate Diagram Maps
---
* [Astah](https://astah.net/download) Professional/UML **ver.10.0** or higher.
* [M PLUS](https://sites.google.com/view/m-plus-plugin/download) plug-in.  
  *NOTE:* If you are generating Diagram Maps for all the specification diagrams, refer to [this page](https://astah.net/support/astah-pro/faqs/#block_fc09dca154add341fd7e2c827d040f4d-5) to increase Astah's memory usage (e.g., -Xmx2048m) because the generation process may fail due to insufficient memory.
