Required to open the model file (uml_specification_2.5.1.asta)
---
* Astah Professional/UML/Viewer **ver.9.2** or higher.

Required to generate Diagram Maps
---
If you are generating Diagram Maps for all the specification diagrams, refer to [this page](https://astah.net/support/astah-pro/faqs/#block_fc09dca154add341fd7e2c827d040f4d-5) to increase Astah's memory usage (e.g., -Xmx2048m) because the generation process may fail due to insufficient memory.
